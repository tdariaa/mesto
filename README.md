## Description

The Mesto project is a one-page site containing a gallery of photographs of beautiful places and unusual views.

Thanks to the use of the JavaScript programming language, the site is interactive.
There is an opportunity to change the name and description of one's occupation, and there is also an opportunity to "like" the photos you enjoy.
It is also possible to remove the "likes".
